# Serverless_Web-Application_on_AWS
Project Name: Serverless Web Application on AWS

In this project, I will build a serverless web application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3. The application will allow users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) items from a DynamoDB table.

**Steps to Build the Project:**

Create a DynamoDB table to store the items. \
* Build a Lambda function to handle the CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table. \
* Use S3 to store and host the web application's static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). \
* Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency. \


**Expected Outcome:**
Upon completing the project, We will have a working serverless web application hosted on AWS.
We will have hands-on experience building a serverless application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront.
Additionally, We will have experience working with AWS services and integrating them to build a complete solution.
